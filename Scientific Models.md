## Types of Models
### Physical Model
Objects representing and aspect of nature. They are used to analyse and study the system they represent, and by adding instruments of measurement, can be used to optimise and design equipment/processes.
>#### Examples
Globes, Architectural Models, Ball and Stick chemical structure

Note that some scientists may refer to Diagrams combined with Mathematics as physical models. This is because the diagram directly relates to a real-world object. **Ignore this unless stated in the question**.
### Conceptual Model
Simplified versions of real world systems, with only the relevant components included. They may look nothing like their real world counterpart, but are used to depict and explain concepts and ideas within the system.
>#### Examples
Maps, Math / Physics Diagrams, Atom Diagram, **Any form of Diagram**
### Mathematical Model
Describing the phenomena in a mathematical way. These models based on scientific concepts can be used to derive other expressions using the rules of mathematics, and combining these equations together can accurately model complex systems.
>#### Examples
Boyle's Law, **Anything with Math**
### Computer Model
As long as computers are used to simulate or illustrate the real-world system / object. Very intertwined with mathematical models as computer simulations often use mathematical models to make calculations for the simulation.
