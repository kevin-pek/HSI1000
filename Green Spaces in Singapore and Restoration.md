## Source and Sink Habitats
**Source** - Older self sustaining forests
**Sink** - Younger habitats, that require connection to source habitats to sustain them
## Types of Green Spaces
### Grasslands
Consists mostly of grass
### Scrubland
Consists of grass and shrubs    
### Woodlands
Sparse tree canopy that is insufficient for forest species to find shelter and food
### Forests
Dominated by trees and other woody vegetation
Singapore's main vegetation type is the Tropical Rainforest
###### Consists of Several Layers
- Emergent Layer
- Canopy
- Subcanopy
- Understorey
#### Primary Rainforest
The OG, untouched forests. Only 10% were left from being razed for agriculture and development in 1900.
Singapore no longer has any Primary Rainforests.
#### Mature Secondary Forest
Forests at later stages of regrowth, they are found at nature reserves, contain species that can be found in Primary forests
#### Young Secondary Forest
Forests in earlier stages of regrowth. They have lower species richness, and are dominated by plants that thrive in soils with low nutrients
#### Exotic Dominated Secondary Forest
Dominated by invasive vegetation that grow and reproduce quickly. Soil in such environments have been degraded from past use.
These forests are unlikely to regenerate naturally.
###### Examples in Singapore
Singapore's Nature Reserves - Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve are Mature Secondary Forests.
###### Terrestrial Forests
Choa Chu Kang, Central Catchment, Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong
#### Mangroves
Singapore's mangroves are all young regrowing mangroves, as they were previously cleared.
Mangroves appear along sheltered coastlines. One can see this when comparing the presence of mangroves in the sheltered western coast, vs the eastern coast.
###### Examples
Sungei Buloh, Kranji Marshes, Pandan Reservoir, Berlayer Creek at Labrador Park, Pasir Ris Park, Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong.
**Exposed Beaches** - Changi Beach, East Coast Park
## Ecological Connectivity
### Significance
Improves the genetic resilience of isolated populations of wildlife.
Forests in Singapore currently exist as relatively small, fragmented patches, which isolate animal and plant populations.
Source-Sink model suggests forest seeds from older forests can reach younger ones, if they are connected.
### Edge Effect
Forest edges are warmer and dryer, which leads to more light penetration of several metres.
This leads to further fragmentation of a forest fragment over time.
Globaly, 70% of remaining forests are 1km from the forest edge.
Having more nature reserves on the edges of green spaces protect them from human intervention.
#### Bukit Timah Nature Reserve
Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is a actually a cluster of forest micro fragments due to the many disturbances such as condominiums and trails.
### Types of Connectivity
- Aerial - Flying above/within canopy
- Arboreal - Moving among treetops, rope bridges.
- Terrestrial - Ecolink at BKE connecting BTNR and CCNR, bridges
- Fossorial - Digging through soil
- Aquatic
#### Ways to Connect Forest Fragments
- Culverts
- Rope Bridges
#### Habitat Enhancement
Habitat enhancement is a long term commitment to establish/enhance a forest.
Consists of soil prep, Sapling Protection Action (SPA) and tree-planting.
#### Important things in Forest Stewardship
- Getting the science correct or "assisting nature the right way".
- Involving all stakeholders in the community.
### One Million Trees Movement (OMT)
Started in 2020, aims to plant 1 million trees by 2030
Aims to recreate forest-like structures along roads, known as nature ways by planting native trees and shrubs, to augment the network of ecological corridors between habitats.
NUS will plant 100,000 trees by 2030 to contribute to the OMT.
### Ecological Profiling Exercise
NParks island-wide EPE will establish a Scientific Advisory Panel, which will open up discussions for land use based on ecological connectivity.
eg. NParks identified source habitats in the Clementi-Ulu Pandan area, which shows the area has ecological connections between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges
Listen and Take notes.
###### What NParks does when complaints about animals are received
Listen and take notes about the animal behaviour
Conduct a site visit to make direct observations of the animal, the behaviour of people there and the environmental conditions at the site
