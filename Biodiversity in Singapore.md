## Biodiversity Concerns in Singapore
1. While sustainability awareness has increased, understanding of biodiversity has not been achieved
2. Land use change, which is very intense in Singapore, fails to prioritise leaving pockets of areas where wildlife is left alone eg. young secondary forests where possible
3. Advocacy education has to be sustained until policy makers and planners understand the issues; One-off engagement is insufficient and can be forgotten
>More than 90% of Singapore's forests were cleared for agriculture in the 19th Century, which came with British colonisation.
>After gaining independence, Singapore also undergone rapid urbanised, and had large scale land reclamation, leaving <30% of land area natural vegetation.
## Importance of Biodiversity
- Biodiversity provides with the food we eat by enriching the soil used for agriculture, pollinators of crops
- Plants and Fungi provide medicinal value
- Coral reefs and mangroves shield coastlines from storms
- Cultural value
## Singapore Green Plan 2030 (SGP 2030)
### Goal
Aims to achieve a 50% increase in nature park land where people can go hiking/bird-watching.
### About
It is 4th in a series of greening visions for Singapore:
**1963 - Garden City**: Economic development
**1988 - City in a Garden**: Recreational spaces, enhancing urban areas
**2011 - Biophilic City in a Garden**: Improving connectivity, protecting natural heritage, and promoting community involvement
**2017 - City in Nature**: Conserving and restoring natural ecosystems, creating world class parks and gardens, and promoting ecological connectivity.
###### SGP 2030 is a multi-agency effort spearheaded by 5 ministries:
1. Ministry of Education
2. Ministry of National Development
3. Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment
4. Ministry of Trade and Industry
5. Ministry of Transport
### 5 Pillars of SGP 2030
1. City in Nature
2. Energy Reset
3. Sustainable Living
4. Green Economy
5. Resilient Future
## City in Nature
### Goal
Aims to **restore and integrate nature into society**, by adding more nature parks for recreation, and strengthening nature connectivity
#### More Nature Parks
Set aside **50% more land – around 200 hectares – for nature parks**.
Having a wide expense of nature in cities, as part of conservation efforts
Ideally, every **household to be within 10 minutes of a park, and every roadway to be a nature way by 2030**.
This will be done by:
- Intensifying nature in our urban landscape
- Intensifying greenery along roadways, using multi-tiered plating which cool the environment, and mimic 
- Introducing Buffer Parks to protect nature reserves
>eg. Bukit Batok, Rifle Range, Chestnut, Dairy Farm, Zhenghua Nature Parks
>This is to shift people away from the biodiversity core
- Improving Connectivity between Parks
>Brings resilience to wildlife habitats
### Examples of Singapore's Success
###### Oriental Pied Hornbill
Came from Southern Johor to Pulau Ubin, then spread through park connectors
###### Smooth-coated Otters (Freshwater Habitats)
Came back to Singapore after efforts to protect fresh water waterways
###### Sisters Island Marine Park (Coastal and Marine Habitats)
Land reclamation projects
###### Cleaning of Singapore's Waterways
Singapore waterways were filled with dumped waste in the 1960s.
Singapore now has a naturalised canal at Bishan-AMK Nature Park.

## Energy Reset
### Goal
Aims to improve energy efficiency, as Singapore does not have the readily available space for large-scale renewable energy projects.
>Reduce energy consumption by more than 8 million megawatt hours per year – sufficient to power almost every household’s annual energy use.
>This also reduces domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 3 million tonnes per year by 2030.
#### Solar Energy
Quadrupling Singapore's solar energy deployment, so that solar energy deployed will be five times that of today by 2030.
#### HDB Towns and Green Living Spaces
Green 80% of all buildings over the next decade.
Singapore's urban setting will also create the ideal environment to fully embrace electric vehicles (EVs).
## Sustainable Living
### Goal
Live in a circular economy, with a high rate of recycling, meaning that resources can be used many times over.
#### Circular Economy
Similar to what was done by NEWater. By turning incinerated waste into NEWSand for construction, we aim to **reduce the waste sent to our landfill by 30%**.
#### Reducing Carbon Emissions
Raise trips taken on mass public transport from 64% to 75% by 2030.
Simultaneously, encourage walking, cycling and active mobility by expanding our cycling network from 460 km to around 1,320 km by 2030.
#### Exo Stewardship Programme
Involves students from Primary to Pre-University levels to genuinely understand sustainability and climate change while feeling empowered to reduce their carbon footprint, make responsible decisions, and create a ripple effect on their families and friends.
## Green Economy
### Goal
Become a leading centre for Green Finance in Asia and globally, creating new opportunities for growth and job creation.
#### 2019 broad-based carbon tax
Used to support projects that help enterprises reduce their greenhouse gas emissions
#### Enterprise Sustainability Programme
Helps enterprises, especially SMEs, embrace and develop capabilities in this area to ride this green wave.
#### Research, Innovation & Enterprise Plan 2025
Attracts companies to anchor their R&D activities in Singapore to develop new sustainability solutions for the world.
## Resilient Future
Focused on building Singapore's climate resilience and enhancing food security.
### Goals
Moderate the increase in urban heat by increasing greenery and piloting the use of cool paint on building facades.

#### 30-by-30 Target
Meet **30% of our nutritional needs through locally produced food by 2030**. We will do this in partnership with a vibrant agri-food industry and our communities.
