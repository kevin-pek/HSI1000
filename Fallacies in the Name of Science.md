## The 8 Fallacies
### What is a Fallacy
A fallacy is **flawed reasoning or logic**, **incorrect or improper use of the scientific method**, or a **deliberate act to misrepresent something**.
#### 1. False Anomalies
When a phenomenon is **fraudulently presented as being mysterious or not explicable by science**.
An extraordinary claim is then provided as an explanation for the phenomena.
###### Crop Circles
Large, circular, symmetrical geometric figures, that “mysteriously” appeared in wheat and corn fields in Southern England and have since been observed in many other countries.
The extraordinary claim is made that the patters were made by aliens or their spaceships.
However, what is purposefully disregarded are “tramlines”, which are either near or run through these patterns. These tramlines are indentations made by tractors as they travel through the crop fields. It has been clearly demonstrated that a hoaxer can simply walk down these tramlines, and with a few simple tools, create these circles quickly and easily.
>By neglecting to mention the “tramlines”, and that it is easy for a people to construct these same patterns with a few simple tools, a false anomaly has been created, creating a "mystery" where there isn't one.
#### 2. Questionable Arguments by Elimination
Similar to [[The Baloney Toolkit#8 Is the claimant providing positive evidence]].
This is when a claimant **considers evidence that disproves alternative explanations to be in support for their explanation**.
###### Extrasensory Perception (ESP)
Often a strategy used to “prove” that someone can read another person’s mind is to simply show that their ability cannot be explained by random guessing, or luck.
>Even under tightly controlled experimental conditions if this were so, it does rule out the possibility of luck at guessing the card, but it **does not prove that the person has ESP**.

This is because anyone can come up with another explanation and use the same argument to support it.
#### 3. Illicit Causal Inferences
**Mistaking correlation for causation**, or when an **out of the ordinary occurence precedes another out of the ordinary occurence**, so one mistakenly concludes that there is a causal link between the 2.
>When you enter a lift as someone else exits, and you smell something bad in the lift, doesn't mean the person that just left had anything to do with it.
#### 4. Unsupported Analogies and Similarities
When the fact that an **explanation using an analogy that works in one case is given as evidence for the correctness of a similar explanation in another case**.
A similar explanation can only at most, guide us to an explanation, but **only careful testing can provide evidence** to prove an explanation.
###### Astrology
>Because the moon influences the tides on Earth, which it does, and sunspot activity can disturb radio transmissions on Earth, which it does, we can conclude that the positions of the planets have an important influence on formation of the human personality.

This is an example of how a similar explanation is incorrectly used as "evidence" for the influence the positions of planets on the human personality.
#### 5. Untestable Explanations and Predictions
Using an explanation that cannot be proven true or false as an explanation.
Examples include using "Fate" as an explanation or conspiracy theories.
Another example is seen in [[Scientific Explanations#Scientific Explanation]].
###### Conspiracy Theories
Conspiracy theories can seem attractive and even plausible because they are immune to falsification. They can be circular in their “evidence” for their theory, like the typical 9-11 conspiracy theories described in our textbook.
The lack of evidence is often used as an argument for conspiracy theories as they believe there has been a cover up, and any evidence against their theory is claimed to have been fabricated.
#### 6. Empty Jargon
Stringing together a **bunch of scientific jargon that means nothing**, in order to convince that something is scientifically established.
>“It’s a bit complicated, but in simple terms it’s a type of quantum entanglement which I can trigger with my mind by creating an Einstein–Schwartzchild gravity trap at the target location. This enables the destabilization of the wavefunction of the object which can then be relatively easily propagated to the trap’s location by tunnelling through the various Riemann manifolds of quantum electrodynamic barriers. The object’s wavefunction then promptly collapses thus allowing me to move the object.”
#### 7. Ad Hoc Rescues
Refers to the situation where an explanation continues to fail scientific testing, but there is **refusal to admit that the explanation is wrong**, and testing continues over and over.
#### 8. Exploiting Uncertainty
Making use of the fact that there in **uncertainty in the evidence**, which is instrinsic to science, and **blowing it out of proportion** to argue that something is not really the case.
###### Climate Change Denial
Memo by Frank Luntz, where he clearly states that their position against the scientific consensus on climate change is closing. Luntz directly said that “you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate”, illustrating the way the fallacy is used.
However, **just because something isn’t 100.000...% certain doesn’t mean that it isn’t certain for all practical purposes**. Think of Prof Lee’s example of the medical test in lecture 8. A third positive test would mean we are now 99.9% certain we have the disease instead of 91% from two positive tests. As we have learnt from the Salk vaccine field trial in lecture 4, we can be very confident that something is correct to an extremely high degree, and **a great preponderance of evidence for something provides an equally great deal of confidence and credibility in conclusions drawn and explanations given**.
## Pseudoscience
Fake science that uses the fallacious methods we discussed in the last section in an attempt to establish credibility when there is little to none present
>The distinction between science and pseudoscience has nothing to do with the distinction between “hard” and “soft” sciences.

**Just because a claim is in the field of science, it does not automatically mean that it is a science.**
###### Immanuel Velikovsky
In the 1950s he hypothesized that the planet Venus was created out of an enormous volcanic eruption on Jupiter. He speculated that during its voyage from Jupiter to is current orbit, as it passed by the Earth, it caused several cataclysmic events.
## Distinguishing Science from Pseudoscience
| Science | Pseudoscience |
| :-- | :-- |
| Is self-correcting. | Not self-correcting. |
| Gradually produces a maturing body of explanatory / theoretical findings. | Produces very little theory. |
| Findings are always open to revision. | Rarely change over time. |
| Embraces skepticism. | Tends to view skepticism as narrow-mindedness, which is also not a valid argument to not test an explanation. |
### Examples of Pseudoscience
#### Astrology
Predictions of human affairs and events by studying the movements of heavenly bodies.
#### Ufology
Study of aliens visiting Earth using spaceships.
#### Parapsychology
Study of psychic phenomena like ESP, Telepathy, Precognition, Clarivoyance, Telekinesis, and other paranormal claims.
#### Immanuel Velocsky / Pseudohistory
His ideas on volcanoes on Jupiter creating Venus, and causing various cataclysmic events.
#### Cryptozoology
Study of mythical entities like Big Foot, Loch Ness Monster, Yetis, the Chupacabra, Bukit Timah Monkey Man.
