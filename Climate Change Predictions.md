## Testing for Confidence in Models
### Hindcasting
Refers to testing models against past observations to make sure they reproduce the same result. The model **must not be tuned specifically to reproduce past observations** however.
Hindcast calculations provide confidence that existing climate models understand the climate processes that led to the current global average temperatures we see today.
###### Example
Giving the model an initial state of 1850/1870, and then allow it to run freely. Without correcting itself based on historical observations, it will produce random variations in the Earth's surface temperature, but not be able to reproduce what was observed historically.

The model has to also simulate natural and anthropogenic changes:
#### Natural Changes
- Solar Variations
- Volcanic Activity
#### Anthropogenic Changes
- Changes in Greenhouse Gases
- Sulphate Aerosols
- Land Use
## Terminology
Climate Scientists use the CMIP6 Model to make 
### Projections
Model-derived estimates of future climate.
### Predictions
The projection that is branded as "most likely" of all other projections.
### Scenario
A coherent, internally consistent, plausible description of a possible future state of the world. Scenarios have demographic, socio-political, economic and technological storylines.
## Scenario Matrix Architecture
Used in the 6th Assessment Report by the IPCC, consisting of RCPs and SSPs.
#### Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)
Describe how socioeconomic factors may change over the century:
1. Population
2. Economic growth
3. Education
4. Urbanisation
5. Rate of Technological Development
###### SSP1
The optimistic "sustainability" pathway. RCP 1.9 and 2.6 are the RCPs with the smallest radiative forcing.
SSP1 describes a world of sustainability-focused growth and equality. Titled “Sustainability—Taking the Green Road”, SSP1 narrates a future in which the world shifts gradually toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries.
###### SSP2
SSP2 describes a world where trends broadly follow their historical patterns. Titled “Middle of the Road”, SSP2 narrates a future in which the world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns.
###### SSP3
SSP3 is pessimistic, having the greatest socioeconomic challenges for mitigation and adaptation.
SSP3 describes a fragmented world of resurgent nationalism. Titled “Regional Rivalry—A Rocky Road”, SSP3 narrates a future in which the world descends into resurgent nationalism, where concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic issues.
###### SSP4
SSP4 is rather pessimistic, describes a world of ever-increasing inequality. Titled “Inequality—A Road Divided”, SSP4 narrates a future in which highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries.
###### SSP5
SSP5 is optimistic, describes a world of rapid and unconstrained growth in eco- nomic output and energy use. Titled “Fossil-fueled Development—Taking the Highway”,
SSP5 narrates a future in which the world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development.
#### Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)
RCPs described different levels of greenhouse gases and other radiative forcings that might occur in the future. These pathways were developed to span a broad range of radiative forcing in 2100. 
The radiative forcings ranged from 1.9 to 8.5 watts per metre squared.
>The RCP 1.9 mitigation target can only be achieved by all models used under an SSP1 narrative.

## Feedback Loops
### Positive Feedback Loop
Positive feedback loops tend to lead to instability via exponential growth.
>Positive feedback loops have an even number of negative couplings, or none.
#### Example
###### Mass of an ice sheet and the Elevation of the ice sheet
When an ice sheet melts, it loses mass, and moves to a lower elevation as a result, where temperatures are higher. This causes the ice sheet to melt faster, completing the feedback loop. The loop will not stabilise, continuing until the entire ice sheet has melted.
###### Increase in surface temperature and Greater Evaporation
Increased temperature leads to greater evaporation, meaning there is more water vapour in the atmosphere. Since water vapour is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapour leads to an enhanced greenhouse effect, causing increased surface temperature.
###### Increased surface temperature and Snow and Ice cover
Increased surface temperature leads to less snow and ice cover, which reduces albedo, causing an enhanced greenhouse effect as more energy from the sun enter's the Earth's system. This then causes increasing surface temperature.
### Negative Feedback Loop
Negative feedback loops produce output that stabilises the system. This is because the output of the system is fed back in a manner that reduces the fluctuation in output.
>Negative feedback loops have an odd number of negative couplingsin diagrams
#### Example
###### Phosynthetic rate of plants and Concentration of $CO_2$
###### Increased surface temperature and Evaporation
As mentioned above, increased temperature leads to more water vapour in the air. This causes more cloud cover, and since clouds are reflective, this increases the Albedo. This causes a decrease in surface temperature.
>There is a contradiction with the positive feedback loop defined above. Whether this loop is positive or negative depends on how much water vapour nucleates to form clouds, and furthermore the effect of clouds is uncertain, and depends on the altitude at which they form.
