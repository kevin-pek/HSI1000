## History of Climate Change
### Discovery of the Greenhouse Effect
The greenhouse effect's discovery can be mainly attributed to Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall and Eunice Foote.
Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier realised that the Earth itself had to emit heat, as without doing so, the Earth would continuously heat up from receiving energy from the Sun.
He called this radiation radiant heat, which we know as infra-red radiation today.
However, even with precise measurements of this radiant heat, and radiation from the Sun, Fourier calculated the Earth's temperature to be $-18\degree C$, which was way below the Earth's average temperature of $-15\degree C$.
This was because Fourier failed to account for the atmosphere, which he surmised, acted as an insulator preventing some of the radiant heat from escaping.
The 2 energy sources most important for warming the Earth's surface are the **Sun and the Atmosphere**.
>The term greenhouse effect was not coined until around 1900 by Swedish meteorologist, Nils Gustaf Ekholm.
### The Atmosphere
> Refer to Week 5 Lecture Notes for more on Discovery of Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, that the atmosphere consists of different types of gases.

###### Blanket metaphor
The atmosphere can be described as a blanket over the Earth, trapping heat emitted from the Earth, and reflecting some heat off from the Sun as well.
However, this metaphor does not work for these processes:
- Sulfate Aerosols scattering radiation back to space, thus more sulfate aerosols leads to a cooler Earth.
- Blankets inhibit convection while the atmosphere enables convection.
### Scientific Consensus on Climate Change
97% of research papers in the field support the existence of climate change.
The observational record shows that average global temperatures are rising.
Variations in natural forcings, solar and volcanic, do not explain the observed increase in temperature.
Instrumental temperature records have been made in North America and Europe for over 100 years, 
## Processes
### The Greenhouse Effect
Process that causes the surface of the Earth to be warmer than it would have been without an atmosphere.
**Carbon Dioxide** and **Water Vapour** are the most important greenhouse gases in the atmoshpere.
#### Sulfate Aerosols
Sulfate Aerosols come from Volcanic Eruptions, which **scatter radiation back of to space**, leading to more energy leaving than entering the Earth system.
#### Melting Tundra
The melting Siberian Tundra releases methane, which is a greenhouse gas that will cause the Earth's. temperature to increase through a positive feedback loop. More on [[Climate Change Predictions#Feedback Loops]]
### Albedo
Ranges from 0-1, is the fraction of light that is reflected off the surface of the planet. Higher Albedo means lower planet temperature.
#### Factors affecting Albedo
- **Cloud Cover** reflects sunlight away from the Earth, increasing Albedo and reducing the amount of energy entering the Earth system.
- **Melting Glaciers** cause bare earth underneath to be revealed, and the reflective ice sheets to disappear. This reduces the albedo, and causes more energy from the Sun to be absorbed into the Earth.
#### Calculating Albedo
Using the single layer atmosphere climate model:
$$F_S=\frac{S(1-A)}{4};\space F_g=\frac{F_s(1+\tau_s)}{(1+\tau_g)};\space F_g=\sigma T^4_g$$
$F_g$ is the radiative flux from the Earth's surface
$F_s$ is the solar flux
$\tau_g$ is the transmittance of terrestrial radiation through the atmosphere, assume 0.1
$\tau_s$ is the transmittance of solar radiation through the atmosphere, assume 0.8
$\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $5.67\times 10^{-8}Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$
$T_g$ is the Earth surface temperature
$S$ is the solar constant $1370Wm^{-2}$
$A$ is the Albedo.
