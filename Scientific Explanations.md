## Definitions
### Scientific Explanation
An account of how/why something is the case that is **testable**.
#### Example
A clairvoyant claims to see the future, but his ability, according to him, doesn't work with tests. Whether he is a clairvoyant is unknown, as his ability is **untestable, and as result, is neither verifiable nor falsifiable**. All we can do is apply [[The Baloney Toolkit]], and conclude that it is unlikely that the person is clarivoyant.
This is an example of Untestable Explanations and Predictions, found in [[Fallacies in the Name of Science#5 Untestable Explanations and Predictions]]
### Hypothesis
Hypothesis are ideas that are tentative/unproven and **have not been subjected to testing and falsification**. They also tend to be specific to a certain phenomena.
>Even a simple hunch about what the reason for a phenomena is counts as a hypothesis.
### Theories
Theories are characterised by the breadth and depth of its explanatory power. They are **well tested with expermental evidence** confirming their rules and principles. They also tend to be applicable to a wider variety of phenomena.
## Correlation vs Causation
When 2 events are correlated, it means **they happen/move in coordination with each other**. If events are related as cause and effect, they can involve a series of linked causes and effects, and may not result from a given cause in every case.
### Example
A strong correlation was found between the number of people who drowned by falling into a pool into a particular year, and the number of films Nicolas Cage appeared in a particular year, from 1999 - 2009.
>This relationship can be used to predict each other within the year range, but not outside the range of years. This is because when there is no established causal links, we do not expect the correlation to hold up when we extrapolate outside the dataset.
## Types of Scientific Explanations
### Cause and Effect
The simplest direct explanation of phenomena. A Causal Mechanism is a linked chain of causes, taking us from the remote cause, through a series of other causes, leading to the effect. In some cases the full chain may not be fully understood, but the link is established.
>###### Examples
>
### Underlying Process
Underlying Process is going down a level and describing the phenomena in a more fundamental process.
>###### Examples
>Brownian motion resulting from molecules colliding with each other.
### Laws
Laws are generalised descriptions of regularities found in nature, and tend to be universal/very general and broad.Â 
>###### Examples 
>Boyle's Law (pressure law)
>- The greater the pressure of a gas above a liquid, the more the gas dissolves into the liquid.
>
>Law of Reciprocity in Psychology.
### Function
Explaining a phenomena based on the function it fulfils. Explanation by mentioning its purpose.
>###### Examples

## Occam's Razor
When given multiple explanations to choose from, it is wiser to first consider the explanation that is the least complex.
>###### Examples
>The model of the solar system, in which the modern system adopted during the scientific revolution was way simpler than the previous model accepted by Ptolemy.
## Scientific Explanations vs Models
[[Scientific Models]] are specific applications of principles/concepts outlined by a theory or hypothesis. 
>###### Example
>Using Newton's 3 Laws of Motion and Law of Gravitation to construct a computer model of the solar system. They can be used to test hypothesis/predict what should happen if a hypothesis is correct. Such as predicting the movement of the planets.

Theories represent the concepts purely.
