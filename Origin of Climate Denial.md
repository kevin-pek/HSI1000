## Climate Change myths:
### Global Warming is caused by the Sun
Sunspot activity of the Sun has been increasing, at the time when the Earth has been getting warmer.
However, over the past 35 years, the Sun has **shown a slight cooling trend**, meaning the Sun and the Earth's temperature have been going in opposite directions.
>This myth is a result of **cherry picking data**, causing false conclusions to be drawn.
### Climate's changed before
Yes but its historically been **over time scales ranging thousands to millions of years**, and never been as extreme as this. 
Additionally, just because climate has changed due to natural causes before doesn't mean that it cannot change due to our human activity, which is a **single cause fallacy**
### The Earth is actually cooling
Inaccurate claim that earth is actually cooling, which is just straight up wrong, as the long-term trend, **measured based on decades** still shows an increasing average temperature.
### Animals and plants can adapt to climate change
No evidence whatsoever to support this claim. Extinction rates today are at least thousands of times faster than the usual based on geological time scales
### Its not Human Activity
Climate change is not due to human activity, claims climate scientists to be alarmists.
Focused on making Ad Hominem attacks on the people, instead of arguing based on reason.
>First, we know that humans are currently emitting some 30 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. Second, oxygen levels are falling as if carbon is being burnt to form carbon dioxide. Third, we know that this carbon is fossil fuels—this is the Suess effect we discussed in the last lecture. And fourth, corals have also been absorbing this fossil carbon more recently.
#### Observations that show CO$_2$ is abosrbing more IR
1. Satellites are measuring less infra-red radiation escaping to space at the precise wave- lengths at which CO2 absorbs. 
2. Surface measurements reveal that this radiation is returning to Earth to warm the surface.
#### Observations that match global warming predictions
1. Increased greenhouse effect would make nights warm faster than days, and this is what has been observed.
2. If the warming was due to solar activity, then the strato- sphere should warm along with the rest of the atmosphere. But if the warming is due to the greenhouse effect, the stratosphere should cool because of the infra-red radiation being trapped in the troposphere. Satellite measurements show that the stratosphere is cooling.
3. This combination of a warming troposphere and cooling stratosphere should cause the tropopause, which separates them, to rise. This has also been observed.
4. It was predicted that the ionosphere would shrink, and it is indeed shrinking.
## Types of Climate Denial
### Science Denial
The idea that the science of climate change is not settled. That there is no consensus. That climate change is just part of the natural cycle. See [[#Climate Change myths]]
### Economic Denial
The idea that climate change is too expensive to fix. This
is a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. Economists estimate that we could fix climate change now by spending 1% of world GDP. However, if we delay to 2050, it could cost over 20% of world GDP. This denial recognises the need for intergenerational equity.
### Humanitarian Denial
The idea that climate change is good for us. That longer, warmer summers make farming more productive. That plants need carbon dioxide and so more of it acts as a fertiliser. That warmer winters will lead to fewer deaths.
This denial is particularly pernicious as it solely considers the effect on people living in temperate climates, and not those living in tropical climates. Further, it’s not even true, but points to the need for international equity.
### Political Denial
The idea that we cannot take action because other countries are not taking action. This denial ignores the historic legacy of greenhouse gas emissions. It further highlights the need to recognise the ethical responsibility of developed nations to take action first.
### Crisis Denial
The idea that we shouldn’t rush into committing to binding interna- tional agreements, given the uncertainty raised by the previous areas of denial.
## Cognitive Biases in Climate Denial
#### Time discounting bias
Our tendency to think in the short term instinctively, where we seek current benefits at a cost to future generations.
>"Climate change is too expensive to fix." is a form of economic denial resulting from this bias, where **future costs are ignored, focusing only present costs.**
#### Illusory Truth Effect / Positive Illusions
**Unrealistic optimism/positive** illusions that new technology will be invented that can solve climate change.
#### Self-Serving bias / Egocentrism
We tend to first determine our preference for a certain outcome based on our self-interest.
>Thinking that one is less responsible for climate change than other parties, and therefore it's fair to do less than other parties.
#### Loss Aversion
Losses feel more significant than gains of the same magnitude.
#### Confirmation Bias
