## List of Questions
#### 1. How reliable is the source of the claim?
The [[CRAAP Test]] can be used to assess the reliability of the source.
Is the source the primary literature from well-respected peer-reviewed scientific journals.
#### 2. Does the source make similar claims?
Does the source consistently make contratrian claims. Mainly refers to when a source makes extraordinary claims, to figure out if the source is biased.
This may suggest that **the source may have a motive other than objective evaluation and interpretation of evidence**.
#### 3. Have the claims been verified by someone else?
Whether the claim has been made by other reputable sources / experts, and more importantly, whether the evidence used to back the claim is **reproducible by other research groups in another part of the world**.
Reproducibility is different from repeatability. **Repeatability** is when a researcher **repeats a measurement many times to establish the uncertainty of their measurement**.
#### 4. Does this fit with the way the world works?
Whether the claim being made makes logical sense, or contradicts our current understanding of the world.
If the observation contradicts our current understanding, then it constitutes an anomaly.
#### 5. Has anyone tried to disprove the claim?
Whether the claim has been tested scientifically.
The existence of counter-arguments against the claim, or alternative reasons for the observation.
#### 6. Where doees the preponerance of evidence point?
Whether there is already a scientific consensus on the matter. Well established theories have a preponderence of evidence supporting them.
Among all possible explanations, which is the most supported by evidence?
#### 7. Is the claimant playing by the rules of science?
Is the explanation derived from the scientific process, and the scientific method is followed in detail. And whether logical and reasonable explanations are being disregarded.
#### 8. Is the claimant providing positive evidence?
Is there evidence provided that directly supports the claim.
>###### Positive Evidence
>Positive evidence refers to the idea that the **absence of something cannot be used as evidence**.
>###### Negative Evidence
> Evidence that refutes other alternative explanations. Note that **proving that all other explanations are false does not mean the last remaining one is true**. It could be that there are other explanations that are unthought of that is the real one.
#### 9. Does the new theory account for as many phenomena as the old theory?
Whether the new explanation is as applicable to the same variety of phenomena the old one is.
This is often ignored by conspiracy theories, as they ignore specific pieces of evidence, or misrepresent it when it is at odds with the theory.
>###### Example
>Newtonian Physics vs Special Relativity
>Newtonian Physics only explains motion for objects travelling at relatively slow speeds, while Special Relativity does so for both slow and fast objects.
#### 10. Are personal beliefs driving the claim?
Is the claim being made even objective in the first place. This is similar to one of the [[The Scientific Method#Considerations when making Scientific Observations]], namely "Have our observations been contaminated by expectation or beliefs?", or the Purpose in the [[CRAAP Test]].
Is the claim being made in the interest of the party expressing the claim, and are there personal biases being made.
