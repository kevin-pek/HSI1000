Correlation of ecological footprint (2008) and the Human Development Index (HDI) (2012)
### Inherent Inequities in Climate Change
>“it is the populations of these economies most vulnerable to climate change who contribute the least to the accumulation of greenhouse gases”

In framing the objective of holding the increase in the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C,
the Paris Agreement associates the principle of equity with the broader goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development,
recognising that effective responses to climate change require a global collective effort that may be guided by the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
### Sustainable Development Goals 2030
A set of goals under the **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development**, which is a global development framework adopted by world leaders at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015.
Agreed by all countries at the UN in 2015
Consists of **17 Sustainable Development Goals**, known as **"The Global Goals"**. They have 169 targets, and 247 indicators used to measure progress towards reaching the targets.

## Hinterland
Refers to the remote areas of a country, away from coasts or banks of major rivers, which supply cities with natural capital and food, and are economically tied to an urban catchment area.
>“a large, powerful urban community (metropolis) and the
surrounding territory (hinterland) which the metropolis
dominates through mainly economic means”

How urban citys are positioned in relation to hinterlands.
>Singapore does not have a hinterland, instead relying on resources of countries around the world
## Singapore's Food and Water Situation
Singapore prioritises food security over sustainable food sources.
More than 75% of Singapore's food is imported.
### Singapore Food Targets
To meet 30% of our nutritional needs through locally produced food by 2030. We will do this in partnership with a vibrant agri-food industry and our communities.
### Singapore's Water Consumption
Singapore consumes 400 million gallons of water a day.
>During the 2015 El Niño, three districts in neighbouring Johor underwent water-rationing in August to September 2015, affecting more than 640,000 industrial and household consumers for a month.

NEWater provides 49% of Singapore's water.
#### Singapore 4 National Taps
The national taps are sources of Potable water for Singaporeans, 2 of which come from technological innovations.
1. Desalination
2. NEWater
3. Local Rainwater Catchment
4. Imported Water
