## What is Science?
Science is the process of understanding the way the natural world works, and why they happen the way they do.
## The Scientific Method
Follows a cycle of **Observation**, **Hypothesis**, and **Testing**.
### Observation
#### Role of Observation
Observation plays 3 key roles in scientific inquiry:
1. It allows us to identify and focus on the relevant facts about the phenomena.
2. It provides clues as to what the explanation of the phenomena might be.
3. Observational data provides the evidence for use to accept / reject a hypothesis.
#### Considerations when making Scientific Observations
There are 5 considerations that need to be addressed when we are making proper scientific observations:
1. Do we have a sense of what the relevant phenomena are?
2. Have we found a way to correct for anything that may have been overlooked?
3. What do we know for sure? What is based on fact, what is based on assumptions / conjecture?
4. Have we considered any comparative data?
5. Have our observations been contaminated by expectation / belief?
#### Anamolous Phenomena
Anamolous phenomena are things that can't be explained with our current understanding of nature. They tend to be highly controversial as they often are at odds with current well-established theories.
However, they are important as:
1. They challenge our accepted ideas, testing what is generally accepted to be true.
2. Their resolution can lead to entire new fields of study.
3. They can lead to new insights and understanding of nature.
4. Their resolution can lead to new instrumentation or experimental methods to study nature, facilitating new discoveries.
>###### extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
Similar to anamolous phenomena, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to prove, as they typically fly directly in the face of our current understanding of the world, which has been obtained from an **extraordinarily large body of evidence**.
>If an extraordinary claim is true, then **some aspect of well-established science would need to be revised**.
#### Examples
###### Galilieo's Observation of Celestial Bodies
Galileo made several observations of celestial bodies which were at the time, anamolous observations.
1. The Moon has a cratered and bumpy surface, which challenge the prevailing notion that celestial bodies were all perfectly smooth spheres.
2. The sun has moving sunspots, which meant that the sun was not a perfectly clean sphere, and that it moves and rotates.
3. Jupiter was observed to have 4 moons, which orbited around Jupiter, contradicting the assumption that all celestial bodies orbited around Earth.
4. Galileo managed to observe all phases of Venus, which should not be possible if Venus orbits around Earth. This suggested that Venus instead orbits the Sun.
###### Copernicus' Model of the Solar System
In this model, all planets moved in perfect circular orbits, with uniform speed around the Sun. Hence the predictions of planet positions were no more accurate than Ptolemy's model.
This is attributed to the fact that he did not address these concerns:
1. Do we know for sure what is based on fact and what on conjecture / assumptions?
>Unlike Kepler, Copernicus assumed that heavenly bodies must move in perfect circles at uniform speed, just like Ptolemy.
2. Have our observations been contaminated by expectations or beliefs?
>Copernicus did not make many observations. He instead took data from others, assuming they were all good and accurate data.
###### The Steam Engine / Industrial Revolution
The steam engine was invented based on advances in the scientific understanding of Energy, Heat, Work, and the second law of thermodynamics. This allowed for:
- Vast improvements to transportation, which improved efficiency of moving materials and food around.
- New machinery that improved agriculture, which coupled with the improved transportation technology, greatly reduced famine.
- The industrial revolution also led to improvements in sanitation with the construction of sewage systems in cities.
However, this led to dependence on fossil fuels, **increasing CO$_2$ in the atmosphere substantially**.
###### Green Revolution
Known as the 3$^{rd}$ Agricultural Revolution, in the 1950s - 1960s, the use of pesticides and synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, which came from the creation of the **Haber-Bosch process**, greatly increased crop yields by several magnitudes.
- Wheat yield in the US increased by 3 times, corn by 5 times. Rice yields in Japan increased by almost 3 times, and so on.Â  
- According to professor Vaclav Smil in his paper on the nitrogen cycle and world food production, it is estimated that if crop yields remained at their level in 1900, 4 times the amount of land would be required to produce the same yield as was produced in the year 2000.

However, this increased our dependence on synthetic fertilisers, which also **increased reactive nitrogen in the environment substantially**.
>Note that while it does contribute to Climate Change, the Haber-Bosch process is not mainly responsible for it.
###### Population Predictions
Population predictions are uncertain mainly because of:
1. How difficult it is to predict how the fertility rate will change in the future.
2. Finding out how many children will be born.
Other aspects like Mortality Rate, how many children surviving to become adults and how many adults today surviving to an old age are highly predictable.
### Evidence vs Authority Based Understanding
#### Evidence
An evidence based understanding of the world, the work and theories of individuals can be checked and closely examined by all, ensuring that only factually correct ideas are accepted.
#### Authority
With an authority based understanding, it is vulnerable to the beliefs, assumptions, conjecture and expectations of the figure of authority, as they have the power to state and enforce what is true or false.
